> Dark Deno Terminal interface for Vim/NeoVim

If you don't want to configure plugins, you don't have to use the plugin. It
does not work with zero configuration. You can use other plugins.

Please read [help](doc/ddt.txt) for details.

The development is supported by

Note: If you want to know why I use Deno or what means "dark powered", please
see "FAQ" section in [help](doc/ddt.txt).
